# Researcher-Turnover-in-Windows
This examines principal investigator by college, department, and clusters of "high" and "low" performing based on historical win rates.  

I am attempting to work on this project from both my Windows laptop and the Workbench on the Linux server.

This originated in the project "Grants Exploratory", from which project I have initially copied several files.  It was meant to be a small investigation as a follow-up to a presentation in that project, but it has grown sufficiently in scope that I have decided to create its own project.

My objectives for this project are to:

- Calculate and investigate turnover by principal investigators
- Cluster the principal investigators using several different methods to identify "high" and "low" performers.
- Calculate turn-over by:
  * Colleges
  * Departments
  * Clusters
  * Source of funding
  * Other cuts
- Draw conclusions and write reports and presentations

Potential additional and/or next steps include 
 - Predicting which cluster a principal investigator belongs to  
 - Seeing how soon and how reliably a principal investigator can be predicted to belong to a cluster, esp as a high- or low-performing cluster
 - Investigating hopeless or "lost causes" principle investigators 
    * By determining the maximum consecutive loss count before a win 
    * Investigating the maximum early career loss count or loss rate before still becoming a top winning researcher
 - Conducting a survivor analysis 
 - Predicting employment duration and turnover per PI
