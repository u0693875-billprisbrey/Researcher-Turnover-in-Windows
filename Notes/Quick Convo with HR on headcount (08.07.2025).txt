Headcount is usually a snapshot of an "as-of" date
It's a distinct count of employee ID's as of whatever date we're looking at
Ignores employee records.  Only way to get a headcount.

If only looking at a certain population, say by job code or department, we can narrow that down--
But headcount is just a distinct count of employee ID's. 

Could work for a date range.

An "avg" count over 10 yrs is a snapshot headcount for several dates in a year.
Then that can be expanded.

This multiple employee records -- kinda have to ignore those or take them out of the equation.  

Has a Tableau dashboard, I could get access, that would show headcounts YoY.

Can I do snapshots given a set of EMPLIDs, like my PI's?  --> Sure.  But out of 3,000 EMPLID's, am I looking at certain dep'ts or job codes?  Or if they were there at any capacity at the U?

They do have some turnover reporting.  Daniel or Tatiana might have more background on that, on a project throughout the years.  Basic turnover reports and YoY headcount dashboard that can be broken down into terminations from U or terminations per record.	

How is Tableau dashboard and snapshot data diff't than my "journey" data? --> Same data.


How does it define active employees?  --> Active job record or if on leave


Looks at most recent action prior to a particular date -- if it's not a termination, then they are active.  

Termination dates by record, and overall.
