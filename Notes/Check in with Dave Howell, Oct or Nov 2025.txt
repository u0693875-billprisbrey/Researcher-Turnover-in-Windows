Luis:  Needs top-down prioritization.	


Asherdan Razdan

From what Erin has said -- A.R. tasked with similar questions from Mitzi.
Bring in A.R. will have slightly different questions and still get to where we want to be at the end.
Faculty and researchers.	


Dave will talk to him on Monday serving with him on a support committee.	

Via Erin --- A.R. would look at faculty retention and bonuses and understanding if we need more of that to steal good researchers.	


Wrap up 2-pg exec summary of where I got to.	

Present clustering.	

A.R. has a lot of overlap with what their jobs are.  A.R.'s title is "Chief Research Officer of Planning and Partnerships."
Initially tasked with our recharge centers.  A.R. looks more to commercialization, building partnerships and industries, and those pieces.  Research administration parts of financials and compliances. Build up portfolio with partnerships (nano-fab lab; is it being utilized.)
