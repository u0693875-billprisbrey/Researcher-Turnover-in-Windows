Discussing Turnover with Dave Howell
3.12.2025

Asked Dr. Rothwell:  What to look at next? --> No time to think about it right now.
She liked looking at expenditures and seeing if there was anything interesting in turn-over data

Lots  of discussions on retention and poaching and being poached.

You can have an award but no proposal if they brought the award with them from another University.
And there are people who don't follow the process.


With my two sets of data (retPropData and retAwardData) I can define a "win" by whether the record appears in Awards data

Compare --
Hire Date
Interval to First Proposal Submission
Interval to First Proposal Win

What is the avg interval to submitting a winning proposal?
Break it down by academic rank (??)  
But academic rank only goes back to 2018, so this might not be as meaningful.
