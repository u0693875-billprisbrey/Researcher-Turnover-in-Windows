Resolving system discrepancies
7.7.2025

ACTION ITEMS: 
- Kaidon to locate a data steward and get Bill access to ps_project_table .
- Kaidon to explore ps_project_table and validate alignment, such as the date of PICH change.
- Assuming it is good, then modify OSP data warehouse workflow or create a view so Bill can look at PICH changes via the view.


SUMMARY:
- The eAwards data table is not a "system of record" for financial purposes, while the OSP data warehouse only pulls from PeopleSoft tables that are designated as "system of record" for finance.
- Due to this, there are a lot of discrepancies with our data warehouse, and Dave/Kaidon does not recommend it be used to track changes in PI's.
- Dave recalls a table, "ps_project_table", that appears to have the changes we are looking for.  Kaidon will investigate.

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss discrepancies between various tables and develop investigation steps to identify changes in PI
PROCESS:
  Discuss Kaidon’s findings and next steps (below)
PAYOFF:
  Determine next steps in identifying PI changes per proposal or award

Problems:
(Copying from a text message from Kaidon):
- Only 640/901 of the awards with PI changes are in the eAward tables, [and] only 312 of them record more than one PI in their transactions, so there is still some disconnect between eAward and the tables powering the OSP DW.

The eAward table poorly reconciles with the OSP data warehouse
   - Proposal ID’s are apparently not consistent
   - The PI emplid in the eAward table does not match the PI emplid in the OSP data warehouse
   - Many of the awards identified with “PI Change” aren’t in the eAwards table, and many of those don’t have a corresponding change in PI

Resolution steps (From a text conversation with Kaidon):
•	Cross reference the eAward final PI with OSP DW PI
•	Update the OSP DW workflows to track PI Changes over time
•	Figure out the Venn Diagram between relevant systems and data sources (eAward, eProposal, ps_gm_awd_% tables) 
o	This will likely involve meeting with people from different teams that know more about these systems


NOTES:

(Due to the comlicated table names, it was difficult to take notes.)

- Bill walks through the agenda and the "problems" from the meeting invite (above.)
- Kaidon discusses the different tables.  Recommends not using eAward.
  Dave: eAwards is not "accounting", system of record. PeopleSoft -is- data of record.  
        GSA needs to know who is financially responsible at the end of day.  That's critical.  Isabella would have some insight into it.
- Kaidon: I was hopeful that the history in eAward would be more comprehensive and reliable.  But maybe it's not a good data source to use.  Differences between CIS apps, and eAwards, and PeopleSoft, and ends up in the tables powering the OSP data warehouse.
- Dave shows off CIS/Finance.  (But all his access has been taken away.)

- overlap between eProposal, eAward, ...?

- eProposal has the "prop" tables.  A button is pressed and writes that data to new tables, V1 and F1 version of the award.  F1 is picked up by GSA .... (kind of hard to follow.)

eProposal is connected to "PeopleSoft" table? --> Sort of, all hosted in the exa-distance (??)  Anything with "uu" prefix is a custom table.

Why so many awards in PSGM but not in eAwards or eProposals? --> Dave: Don't know.  Not every award will have a corresponding proposal.  Like a PI that transfers to us.  How big is the discrepancy? --> Kaidon:  Pretty big.

Maybe eAward existed after a certain date?  Maybe something like that going on? --> Isabella could help explain the pipeline.  I've never had to deal with the data.  Not considered the data record.  Discusses "tables of record."

Kaidon:  Tracking PI changes, the eAward data set won't be helpful.  After modifying the OSP data workflow, I'll try that going forward.  Unless there's some needle-in-a-haystack table somewhere.


It's not fed into the OSP data warehouse.    eAward is not the system of record.  PeopleSoft is the system of record for -finance.-
 
 
eAward is the system of record for [[something else.]] Unclear why there is so much discrepancy with PeopleSoft.

Kaidon (...)

Dave:  GCA really looks at the project level.

Kaidon: two different PI's rolling up to the same contract.  Looks like the PI from the primary project will be the PI at the proposal level.

Dave: PI's and co-PI's.  Whatever project is flagged as primary should be considered the PI for the reward.

Kaidon:  Co-PI assumption-- I can bring it in.  a proposal with three projects, a main PI and two co-PI's.

Dave:  And see who is on it previously? We could create a fact table, Type 2, slowly changing.  That's another way we could do it.  We could discuss it during "code review."  There's not a lot of data modellers on the team that do this right now.  Dominic has done a lot on the student side.  I don't know that Rob (?) has a lot of experience with this kind of data modeling.

Kaidon: Not understand the flow of the data.  

Bill:  It would be nice to get a flowchart of these tables?  How the data flows and why they are?

Bill: What's the strategy for finding the PI changes?
  A script that applies to [[acronym]]. Huh? 

Looking at a peoplesoft table, (system of record), whos a change reason (PICH) but not change_from or change_to, but we have two projects associated with this contract.  Then we have a name in the "COMMENTS" field.
Other "COMMENTS" don't have a name or unid in the field.  


Bill:  Looks like the historical data is -lost- short of finding a magic table/needle-in-the-haystack that has all the information we need.  (Kaidon nods.)

Dave:  I went through a rabbit hole on this one. . . ps_project_team .  It does have start and end dates. I don't know if it's in BIPR.  Discusses a screenshot from a year ago.	

Looking at a project with TWO PI's !  And two EMPLID's!  Maybe we have it.

Bill:  And if their EMPLID's are associated with a project at all, then they must be important, and we should include them in our target population.

Dave:  Look at the translate table. 

Bill:  Can I have access to the table? --> Data stewardship.  Theresa Ashman was the data steward, and it was being done by 3 people (committee) and now a CDO if that will go back to him.  Unclear what stewardship of financial data is.

Dave:  Could be using the PI in a different context.  --> PI-adjacent is still interesting.

Kaidon: We have 3,200 unique PI's in this data.  Roughly the same as the 2,900 in my proposal data.	

Kaidon/Dave:  Use this as a view, or as bridge table?  Maybe a view is o.k. that Bill has access to.

Dave:  See if the dates are lining up. The PICH dates should align.
