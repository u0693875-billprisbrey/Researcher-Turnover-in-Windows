Brute Force and to-do musings
9.3.2023

The concurrent jobs are really tough for me.  I keep double-counting entries and exits, as sometimes the concurrent jobs overlap and 
sometimes they don't.

I don't have an easy way to identify "university" boundary events,

But, what if I used an approach that I'm calling "brute force" ?  That is, per EMPLID, I create a dataframe that has every single day as one column.  Then I have a "university" column, that adds if there is an entry and subtracts if there is an exit.  It is paired with a column per EMPL_RCD of exits and entries.

The logic is such that it can never be a one or a zero -- it simply won't allow it.  

Or, if it becomes one of these out-of-bounds values, then it's a flag to investigate.  It could be a kind of double-check as well.

I worry that it will take a long time to calculate.

But I think this is worth pursuing.


3 things to do--
- Brute force per EMPLID
- Time between actions
- Max entry before 2013

- But I might just need to turn this into its own project.
This is not becoming even a simple fix.
