Notes, "PI Turnover:  Progress Meeting"
6.9.2025


PURPOSE:  The purpose of this meeting is to review project status and determine next steps
PROCESS:
-- Review action items from prior meeting:
     - Dave Howell on PI definitions and PI-adjacent population
     - Kaidon Spencer on acquiring full HR data of movement and action reasons for all individuals with activity after Jan 1, 2010
     - Kaidon to update on obtaining “academic age” from Dimensions data
-- Bill to share “Exploratory Data Analysis – Intermediate” (draft to be sent out)
PAYOFF:
Determine next steps and advance the project

ACTION ITEMS:
Kaidon to send:
    --  Explanation of age confidence levels in email
    --  Query of "Dimensions" data with naming convention as described by Dave
In another meeting:
    --  Conduct an overview of the "Dimensions" data

Bill:
    -- Expand verbal description to clarify what percentage of the institutions is in "prolific" (otherwise it reads as if I've just 'discovered' the institutes.) 
    -- Add "unassigned" to the graphs describing the clusters (count, population, etc) because they also appear on the "turnover" graphic.

SUMMARY:

- HR is in progress in providing the query to the data; I may need Brian Harris' permission to access it.
- Regarding the PI definition:  Because we use slowly-changing dimension tables, we might be over-writing PI fields as projects transfer from one to the next.  Losing the turnover signal that we're trying to find.  We end up with things like a PI's first reward before they are hired.
- Dimensions data:
  Kaidon provides an overview.  The team discusses "confidence" in matching a PI to a publication, establishing "academic age."
- Bill wonders:  Can we extract the number of publications per institution? --> Dave suggests we set up a separate meeting to get an overview of Dimensions data.
- Bill walks through three cluster documents (one dimensional filter based on count, two dimensional "rate", and multi-dimensional "complex")
    -- Bill should clarify in verbal description what percentage of "Prolific" cluster #5 belongs to the institutions
- Bill walks through the intermediate retention exploratory analysis
    -- Because the clusters don't include changes over time, it shows that there are no additions to Cluster 5 "Prolific" because we didn't hire someone in the last three years who matched ten years' of activity of our other "Prolific" PI's.
    -- The team discusses adding changes over time to the clustering, or using machine learning to "predict" who could be Cluster 5 / looks like they should be in Cluster 5 



NOTES:

Ok to invite Gratiana to these meetings.

Kaidon to send explanation of confidence levels in email
    --  Query of "Dimensions" data with naming convention as described by Dave

Should we include columns that define the confidence levels? Like PubMed ID?
Break into "Min Pub" and "Max Pub"


"CONFIDENCE_DESC"             
"Likely incorrect: Duplicate Names with no middle name or good department information available"
"Ambiguous or incorrect match"
"Moderate confidence: One-to-many Name + Dept matches, strong Name + Middle Name match, or manually validated"
"Very low confidence: Common/duplicate Name-only match; no department info"
"Low confidence: Likely correct Name match with limited department info"
"High confidence: ORCID, PubMed, or exact Name + Department (1:1 match)"


Number of publications per ID ?
Number of publications per INSTITUTION ?
Set up a diff't meeting to discuss--

PI DEFINITIONS ?

Still working on it.  SCIF application.  And "urgent request" for a data budget.
Following up with OSP (and he's low on their priority list.)  

We might be over-writing PI definitions as projects transfer from one to the next.  Losing the turnover signal.
And we end up with the first reward before they are hired.

Interesting things on HR data set -- very curious on how it influences it


Un-assigned:  They should show up on my graphs describing the clusters (% of PI's, count of proposals, etc) (since they show up on turn-over)
