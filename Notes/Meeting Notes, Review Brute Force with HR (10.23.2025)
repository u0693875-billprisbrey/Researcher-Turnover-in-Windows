10/23/2025

Attendance:  Kirsten Allen, Brian Gelsinger, David Howell, Bill Prisbrey 

Action Items: 

- Brian will provide a SQL query that will provide a list of EMPLIDs and basic fields like department or college on snapshot dates (Jan/July) going back five to ten years.  Estimated completion date of Friday 10/31/2025. 
- Bill will proceed with the next steps, including using the snapshot data as a validation data set, focusing on the chemical engineering department.   


Notes:  

- Bill reviewed the "Demonstrating Brute Force Fit" report with the team.  
- The resulting headcount is too high: Brian's dashboard shows ~30,000 current employees while the headcount estimate shows about ~40,000 current employees. 
- Brian will provide snapshot data to guide improving the algorithm.
