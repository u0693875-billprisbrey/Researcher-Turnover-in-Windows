Maybe I could take a small extract of people and modify my "headcount" formulas.  Then I can slowly increase the target population and deal with mistakes as I come across them?

Another way is to see if I can get a consistent headcount/boundary result with the new information.

It's tricky, because each EMPL_RCD should be completely bounded.
But I don't think I necessarily want to count a new EMPL_RCD as a boundary.
There's some thinking here --- do I take the earliest entry and the last exit?  The new job codes will certainly help.  

Employees with multiple EMPL_RCD is definitely a special case.  I can probably extract them to deal with them especially, and focus on the majority that don't have multiples.

I also need to write up my "project risk" document. 

So I'd like to:
- Update entry and exit definitions
- Tally and double-check
- Update the headcount formula
- Deal with multiple EMPL_RCD employees separately
- Write up the "project risk" document
