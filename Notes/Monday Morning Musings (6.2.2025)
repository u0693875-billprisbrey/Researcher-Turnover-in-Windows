So where are we?

Clustering
  esp Percentiles
EDA
  esp Percentiles
Population definition
  maybe its own child
  Read through definitions and wait for answers
  Get the query (?) that defined the PI view (? Or wait for HR data?)

Waiting for all-l-l-l that HR data
Reading the book chapter on turnover
Do a survival model

I need to finish my reports on identifying high- and low- performers.
Turn them into presentations as well.
   -- This requires turning my descriptive quad graphic into a stand-alone function (!)
Especially, I need to write the child that focuses on the percentiles.
