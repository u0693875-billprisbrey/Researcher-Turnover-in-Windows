HR Metrics

Now that I'm happy with my calculation and plot of headcount, turnover, and delta ....

What other metrics can I calculate?

According to https://whatfix.com/blog/employee-churn/

What I'm calling "turnover" I should more accurately call "churn" per their reference table:

Metric // Voluntary or Involuntary?	// Do you plan to backfill the role? //	Formula

  Employee Attrition	
  Voluntary	
  No	
  (Average number of departures in a given period / Average number of employees in that period) * 100

 Employee Turnover	
 Both	
 Yes	
 (Year, quarter, or month employee departures/ average headcount) * 100
 
 Employee Churn	
 Both	
 Either	
 (Number of employees left/ total number of employees remaining during a year, quarter, or month) * 100
    
    
Since I lost the format when copying the table, here it is in some words:

"Attrition" is voluntary loss of employees that you don't intend on replacing (backfilling).

"Turnover" is both voluntary and involuntary departures that you intend on replacing.

"Churn" is everything:  all departures (voluntary and involuntary) regardless of whether you intend to replace them.

A quick bit of googling finds that these defintions aren't universal.

And chatGPT gave me this interesting set of metrics:

Metric //	What it Tracks //	Formula
Turnover Rate	
Exits	
Exits / Avg Headcount

Hire Rate	
Additions	
Hires / Avg Headcount

Growth Rate	
Net growth	
(End HC - Start HC) / Start HC

Churn Rate	
Movement (in + out)	
(Hires + Exits) / Avg Headcount

Stability Index	
Retention	
HC â‰¥1yr Tenure / HC one year ago


They include hires in their "churn" rate.

So should I re-name my "turnover" to "churn?"

Maybe for clarity I'll calculate:
Hire rate
Term rate
Delta rate

...and not worry about "turnover" or "churn"

"Growth rate" is intriguing --- really is.  Worth calculating?

And what about plotting?
Now I have two more plots.
Do I make it adjustable so I can select which ones and in which order?
How much work would that be?
