Developer's Notes

To Do List

- Adjust "individual journey" app as follows: 
  - Add a "key" graphic or legend that explains all the symbols 
  - Add the "brute force" fit graphic 
- Create a new column called "university boundaries" 
  - After "assignBoundaries", create and apply "modifyBoundaries" that creates the "univ_bound" column
    - If the EMPLID only has a single job / no concurrent jobs, then use exit/entry values (?? I gues? ??)  
  - Adjust the "calculateMetrics" and/or "deltaHeadCount" and "plotMetrics" as needed to use the "start/stop" values in this column
