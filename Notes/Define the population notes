Definition of a PI from the Regulation Library, Rule R7-200B: 
https://regulations.utah.edu/research/rules_7/r7-200b.php#a.II

Roles and responsibilities of a PI from the OSP website: 
https://osp.utah.edu/policies/handbook/roles-responsibilities/principal-investigator.php

Additional questions:
How does this process show up in the data?  Have departmetn heads declined a proposal?  Or have they given the proposal to somebody else / submitted the proposal and designated someone else as PI?

"Rule 3.A.6.
Eligibility is not a guarantee of institutional endorsement. Department, college, and university leadership reserve the right to review each proposed project, evaluate any risks and committed resources, and support or decline projects on a case-by-case basis. Formal departmental approval is obtained in completing the proposal intake materials filed with OSP.

Hi Dave,

Some starter questions (and I haven’t completely read through everything yet.)

- How is a PI designated?  Does their Department Chair approve them to submit a proposal, or do they just submit a proposal and name themselves?
- Are co-PI’s designated in our data set?
- Is it possible that someone is listed as a PI but are actually a PI “mentor”? (Item 1, Overview of PI Responsibilities:
“The PI assumes the primary leadership role on a project. During proposal or project development, the PI (or PI’s mentor) is officially designated on the university proposal intake materials filed with the Office of Sponsored Projects.” 
- What are the “designees” and sub-recipient PI’s?  Are they designated in our data anywhere?  (Item 5, “Overview of PI Responsibilities”)  
- When someone loses PI/co-PI status --- where is that change stored?  Are they erased from our database history, as if they never were a PI/co-PI?
- What is a “PI applicant”?  Are “applicants” and “mentors” tracked? (3.A.5, “Eligibility and Responsibilities”)
