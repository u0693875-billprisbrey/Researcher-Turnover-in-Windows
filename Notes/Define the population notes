Subject: RE: Notes, PI Retention at the U

Hi Dave,

Some starter questions (and I haven’t completely read through everything yet.)

- How is a PI designated?  Does their Department Chair approve them to submit a proposal, or do they just submit a proposal and name themselves?
- Are co-PI’s designated in our data set?
- Is it possible that someone is listed as a PI but are actually a PI “mentor”? (Item 1, Overview of PI Responsibilities:
“The PI assumes the primary leadership role on a project. During proposal or project development, the PI (or PI’s mentor) is officially designated on the university proposal intake materials filed with the Office of Sponsored Projects.” 
- What are the “designees” and sub-recipient PI’s?  Are they designated in our data anywhere?  (Item 5, “Overview of PI Responsibilities”)  
- When someone loses PI/co-PI status --- where is that change stored?  Are they erased from our database history, as if they never were a PI/co-PI?
- What is a “PI applicant”?  Are “applicants” and “mentors” tracked? (3.A.5, “Eligibility and Responsibilities”)
