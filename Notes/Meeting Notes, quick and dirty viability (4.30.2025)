Notes
Turnover Quick'n'Dirty Viability
4.30.2025

Attendance:  Bill Prisbrey, Dave Howell, Greg Francom

Action Items:
- Dave to investigate negative and zero values for rehire-to-termination intervals (after Bill sends a list.)
- Dave to investigate:
	- Obtaining information that could describe voluntary and involuntary separation (who was fired vs who quit)
	- Obtaining birthdates from HR (so we can see if the declining number of PI's correlates with old age and retirement.)
- Bill to investigate: 
	- Proposal submission dates against the hire/rehire/termination intervals
	- Number of PI's submitting each year
	- Tighten up interval definitions and aggregations
	- Fix x-axis graph labeling
	- "Tendrils" on the per-week graph of active PI's
	- Compare the mean proposal award and see if it is climbing (to verify the declining number of PI's since COVID.)
	- Compare counts of hire/rehire/termination dates on the same graphic
	- Compare PI's submitting proposals against this view for completion's sake

Summary: 
- Bill asks how the view with the HR data is defined; what defines a PI for inclusion in this view?
- Rehire date is after the termination date in one case, and on the same day for a few others.  Dave will investigate. 	
- The lack of an initial termination date to pair with the initial hire date causes some confusion and guess-work as to when people are actually actively researching.  For example, if someone worked for a semester as a janitor as an undergrad, and then came back 15 years later as a researcher, the data will count her in the denominator of the turnover calculation for those 15 years.  This means the turnover calculation is incorrect.
- Bill wonders:  Can we identify voluntary vs involuntary separation?  --> Dave thinks there might be a "reason for update" field with a code attached to it in PS_JOB.
- The number of active PI's has declined since COVID.  Dave thinks this may be age and retirement.  Dave will try and get the birthday so we can include.
- The turnover has increased every year, dramatically increasing in 2024.
- This is a quick'n'dirty report with some problems:
	- The definition of "active researchers" has problematic assumptions as described above. 
	- The headcount of active researchers (between hire and termination date) by week has "tendrils" that need to be explained.
	- X-axis labels are shifted and interval aggregations need to be double-checked.
	- Kruskal-Wallis is not a very sensitive test nor the most appropriate for a time series
- A visual inspection of the "per cluster" trends shows two clusters moving together, one cluster consistently below the others, and two clusters with volatile and large turn-over.  This invites a closer look.   



PURPOSE:  Share initial findings from a first look at turnover
PROCESS:
  - Share exploratory data analysis of retention data
 - Share quick’n’dirty comparisons of turn-over calculations
PAYOFF:
  Team is updated on progress


Notes:

PI_INDICATOR -- Means they ARE a PI.
We also have a SPO or Sponosored Project Officer who walks through a proposal
Someone can be a SPO and PI
IS_PI -- Same as PI_INDICATOR (?)  One is a Boolean.  Not sure

There's a table in PS soft called "PeopleJob" with hire and re-hire data.

How did PIs get into this view?  Is it because their PI_INDICATOR is TRUE, and if so, how is PI_INDICATOR defined?  Is it because their EMPLID was identified as a PI submitting a proposal?

  
Dave will send me the query/provenance.

create or replace view VPR.D_PI_EMP_DT_VW asSELECT     pi."PI_DIM_KEY",    pi."PI_EMPLID",    pi."PI_FIRST_NAME",    pi."PI_MIDDLE_NAME",    pi."PI_LAST_NAME",    pi."PI_NAME",    pi."PI_EMAIL_ADDRESS",    pi."PI_PHONE",    pi."PI_INDICATOR",    pi."IS_PI",    pi."PI_LOAD_DATE_TIME",    pi."PI_UPDATE_DATE_TIME",    emp.hire_dt,    emp.rehire_dt,    emp.termination_dtFROM osp.d_pi_vw piLEFT JOIN uuetl_hr.PS_UU_EMPLOYMENT_VW emp ON pi.pi_emplid = emp.emplid


Taking from PS_UU_EMPLOYMENT_VW

PI_DIM_KEY -- primary key for fact table (Kimball's).  It will be unique per person, but not the EMPLID.  DIM_KEY just increments by one, and is present in the fact table.

LOAD/UPLOAD enables tracking of the data.

Looking at "durations" -- 
Some people had 50 yrs until "rehire" and came back as an emeritus.

We only have their most recent termination date.
Dave HAD a termination date, then it was erased when he was re-hired.

Negative value might be a sabbatical.  Re-hire date is in the future, for the faculty point.

When REHIRE_DT == TERMINATION_DT

HR data tends to be pretty clean.

Send some of the emplids to Dave/ sleuth it.


Proposal data only goes back 10 yrs --- 

VOLUNTARY SEPARATION vs INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION ...?

PI's aren't necessarily faculty members.  Faculty are typically Jan 1st and July 1st. 

For Dave:
CAN WE IDENTIFY VOLUNTARY vs INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION? 
"Reason for termination" field in PS_JOB (data update field with a code attached to it.)


Figure out what the "tendrils" are on week-by-week.

Declining PI's and increasing alarming/interesting.

- Let's look at AGE when they terminate.  Is this a demographic artifact?

- Let's look at proposal data.  Are active PI's submitting proposals decreasing since COVID?


GET BIRTHDATES.
GET VOLUNTARY/INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION.

Create a table of HIRE DATES/REHIRE DATES like I've done for TERMINATION DATES.  Has that gone down?
