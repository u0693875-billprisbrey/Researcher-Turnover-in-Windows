Subject: Academic Age Dataset

Hi Bill,

I’ve granted the dataset over to the DATASCIENCE schema. The object is VPR_DIMENSIONS.DS_UU_ACADEMIC_AGE.
In order to see the dimensions <-> emplid mapping confidence and description, you can run the following:

select distinct
               confidence,
               confidence_desc
from vpr_dimensions.dimensions_crosswalk
order by confidence
;

The following query should contain the datapoints we discussed earlier today. I also added first/last/total grants from the Dimensions dataset since it was readily available and thought it may be of use to you. 
select
               dc.emplid,
               daa.first_pub_yr,
               daa.last_pub_yr,
               daa.total_publications,
               daa.first_pub_title,
               daa.first_pub_id,
               daa.first_grant_yr,
               daa.last_grant_yr,
               daa.total_grants,
               dc.dim_id,
               dc.confidence,
               dc.confidence_desc
from vpr_dimensions.dimensions_crosswalk dc
left join vpr_dimensions.ds_uu_academic_age daa on daa.uu_researcher_dim_id = dc.dim_id
where confidence <> 'W'
;
Let me know if you have any issues accessing these objects. Note, there is no guarantee that all of the PIs are represented here. I haven’t done that analysis yet, and am not sure what proportion of the PI population we’ve currently mapped to Dimension profiles, although I suspect the majority have been mapped.
