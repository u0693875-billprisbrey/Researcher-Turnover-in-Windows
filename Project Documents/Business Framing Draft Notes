Business Framing Draft Notes
4.14.2025

PURPOSE:  This document describes the business question provoking an investigation into turnover by principal investigators.

HISTORY:  On 13 February 2025, Bill Prisbrey presented his Powerpoint slides titled "Grants Exploratory Phase I Winning 7b" to Dr. Erin Rothwell and others.  His section describing win rates by principal investigator (PI) characteristics elicited several questions on whether we can identify "low" and "high" performing investigators; how we can support them better; and whether we are retaining our top performers.

BACKGROUND: In order to achieve Dr. Taylor Randall's objective to increase research to a $1 B milestone, the Office of Sponsored Projects believes that a disproportionately small percentage of investigators are responsible for the majority of research funds (consistent with the Pareto principal, where 20% of the population are responsible for 80% of the results.) The Office wonders if the high-performing few are experiencing high turn-over due to being poached or are departing for other institutions, and the financial impact if they can be retained.

SCOPE:  28,790 proposals over ten years by 2,936 principal investigators.

STAKEHOLDERS:
Dr. Erin Rothwell
  As the Vice President for Research, Dr. Rothwell heads the Office of Sponsored Projects and is the sponsor of this analysis project.
  
  Her primary objective is accelerating the University of Utah's accomplishment of the $1 B milestone through improved retention of top-performing principal investigators.

  She is limited in her ability to directly affect retention and turn-over, as she does not sit on tenure committees nor is consulted in faculty hiring decisions.  However, she can affect policy by making recommendations to President Randall 
  
  Although she does not sit on hiring or tenure committees and cannot directly determine faculty hiring or tenure, she can provide recommendations to President Taylor who in turn can direct HR policy and influence the Deans in recruiting and retention.

DRAFT NOTES:

Should I convert this to a Markdown?  Although it will look better, it will lose its accessibility of people adding comments or feeling free to modify it.  So I can keep it as a "txt" file, or I could try to publish it as a Word document.  But then I wonder how a "Word" document would look inside GitHub.
