***STATUS:***  Under investigation

***ISSUE NAME:***  Definition of a PI    

***ISSUE ID:*** 002

***DATE IDENTIFIED:***  27 June 2025    

***DESCRIPTION:***  

  An employee is identified as a principal investigator and attached to every proposal and award. They are defined [here](https://regulations.utah.edu/research/rules_7/r7-200b.php#a.II) with certain responsibilities described [here](https://osp.utah.edu/policies/handbook/roles-responsibilities/principal-investigator.php).  However, these documents don't clearly identify how an employee becomes a principal investigator.   
  
  * Is the population self-selecting?  Can any faculty member submit a proposal and designate themselves as a principal investigator?   
  * Is there an application process to become a principal investigator?   
  * Are there gatekeepers that can determine or influence the designation of a principal investigator?   What are their criteria?
  
***IMPACT LEVEL:***   

  High/Critical.  This threatens project viability.    

***PROJECT IMPACT:***   

  The purpose of the project is to investigate turnover of principal investigators in order to improve retention, and consequently improve research spending.   
  
  This requires a clear definition and clean identification of the entire population of principal investigators and potential principal investigators, currently and historically, including employees who have departed the University.
  
  Unless the phenomena under investigation is clearly defined, confidence in the analysis will be weakened and could lead to false conclusions and ineffective recommendations.    

***ASSIGNED TO:*** Dave Howell   

***ACTION PLAN OR RESOLUTION STRATEGY:***     

  - Dave will consult with Kristy Thompson for clarification on the process to designate an employee as a PI.      

***LOG:***    

*30 June 2025:*  Team meets and discusses the issue and potential solutions.  

*2 July 2025:*  Dave identifies a document describing [PI eligibility](https://osp.utah.edu/grant-life-cycle/develop-proposal/understand-pi-eligibility.php):   

  * A person holding appointment as either a regular or career line faculty member may be designated as a principal investigator (PI) by the department head with the approval of the dean.   
  
This suggests some sort of application and approval process, even if it is informal, including denials and rejections.   

  * . . . the National Institutes of Health has begun to formally allow more than one PI on a single research award.    
  
It is not clear how our database manages multiple PI's on a single award.   

  * The PI applicant must have the necessary experience and independence to compete for his/her own sponsored program and to administer the project should it be funded, as judged by the Department Chair and Dean.    
  
This suggests that there is, or could be, a record somewhere of PI applicants and their status.
