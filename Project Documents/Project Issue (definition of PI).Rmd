***STATUS:***  Under investigation

***ISSUE NAME:***  Definition of a PI    

***ISSUE ID:*** 002

***DATE IDENTIFIED:***  27 June 2025    

***DESCRIPTION:***  

  An employee is identified as a principal investigator and attached to every proposal and award. They have certain responsibilities as described (here)[get the right link.]  However, this document doesn't clearly identify how an employee becomes a principal investigator.   
  
  * Is the population self-selecting?  Can any faculty member submit a proposal and designate themselves as a principal investigator?   
  * Is there an application process to become a principal investigator?   
  * Are there gatekeepers that can determine or influence the designation of a principal investigator?   What are their criteria?
  
***IMPACT LEVEL:***   

  High/Critical.  This threatens project viability.    

***PROJECT IMPACT:***   

  The purpose of the project is to investigate turnover of principal investigators in order to improve retention, and consequently improve research spending.   
  
  This requires a clear definition and clean identification of the entire population of principal investigators and potential principal investigators, currently and historically, including employees who have departed the University.
  
  Unless the phenomena under investigation is clearly defined, confidence in the analysis will be weakened and could lead to false conclusions and ineffective recommendations.    

***ASSIGNED TO:*** Dave Howell   

***ACTION PLAN OR RESOLUTION STRATEGY:***     

  - Dave will consult with Kristy Thompson for clarification on the process to designate an employee as a PI.      

***LOG:***
