*ISSUE NAME:*  Changes in PI not tracked    

*ISSUE ID:* 001

*DATE IDENTIFIED:*  27 June 2025    

*DESCRIPTION:*  

  The Office of Sponsored Projects does not track changes to their databases.  This means that past records are changed to align with the present reality, including the principal investigator attached to a proposal or a grant.  This introduces anomalies (where a PI could listed on a proposal before they were hired, for example) and obscures the past (where a PI could be replaced on a winning proposal, for example).
  
  This is a subset of a larger problem of understanding how principal investigators are identified and defined.
  
*IMPACT LEVEL:*   

  High/Critical.  This threatens project viability.    

*PROJECT IMPACT:*   

  The purpose of the project is to investigate turnover of principal investigators in order to improve retention, and consequently improve research spending.   
  
  This requires a clear definition and clean identification of the entire population of principal investigators and potential principal investigators, currently and historically, including employees who have departed the University.   
  
  However, the database used by the Office of Sponsored Projects does not track changes.  If a principal investigator departs, then their employee identification number is replaced with that of a new principal investigator.  Past records are instantly updated as well, leading to anomalies like a principal investigator attached to a proposal before they were hired.  The former employee would only be identified as a member of the target population if they had their ID's attached to other projects in the database that had already ended.    
  
  This obscures the definition of the target population of principal investigators.  It is possible to fail to identify an employee as a principal investigator, because they departed and were replaced in the tables listing principal investigators.  It could be inflating the contribution of other principal investigators as they inherit or absorb proposals by departing principal investigators.    
  
  Because the very phenomena under investigation is being erased, confidence in the analysis will be weakened and could lead to false conclusions and ineffective recommendations.
